/// Makes the registry-visible / `[Transient]` split a compile-time decision
/// rather than something you discover the first time a scene reloads.
///
/// Every mutable instance field on a Behaviour is one of three things:
///
/// 1. **Registry-visible** — a type the component registry can save, inspect and
///    carry across a hot reload. Nothing to do.
/// 2. **Explicitly `[Transient]`** — a cache, a handle re-acquired in OnStart,
///    anything derivable. Nothing to do.
/// 3. **Neither**, which is the case this reports. The field silently does not
///    survive a save, and may or may not survive a reload depending on whether
///    `BehaviourState` happens to be able to carry its type. That "may or may
///    not" is the whole problem: the failure shows up as a value quietly
///    reverting, minutes later, with nothing pointing at the field.
///
/// `readonly` fields and auto-property backing storage are excluded for the same
/// reasons `BehaviourState.CapturableFields` excludes them — a `readonly` value
/// belongs to the constructor, and a property carries its own attributes.
///
/// This is a warning, never an error: a field that is genuinely neither is a
/// legitimate thing to have while a Behaviour is being written, and an analyzer
/// that stops the build during that is an analyzer people turn off.
