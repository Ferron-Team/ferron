//! Rendering a frame to a PNG with no window.
//!
//! This exists because until it did, the only way to check that a change had not
//! broken the picture was to look at the running editor — which means a person,
//! a display, and a screenshot, none of which a test has. The render graph's
//! golden pins synchronisation and says nothing at all about pixels; a lighting
//! term that silently went dark passes it.
//!
//! What it renders is deliberately the whole real path: the same
//! [`VulkanRenderer`], the same passes, the same scene the editor opens with.
//! Only the target differs — see [`VulkanRenderer::offscreen`] — because a
//! capture taken through a simpler path would be evidence about that path rather
//! than about the frame anyone actually sees.
//!
//! It needs a GPU, so nothing here runs in CI. `tests/offscreen.rs` is the entry
//! point and is `#[ignore]`d for that reason.
