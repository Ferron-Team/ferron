//! The punctual shadow atlas: which lights get tiles, where those tiles are,
//! and what matrix each one is drawn with.
//!
//! A point light is six frustums and a spot light is one, so the natural shape
//! is not one image per light but one image with a tile per *face*. That is what
//! makes this affordable in a graph whose resources are unversioned: every face
//! is a viewport into the same attachment, so the whole thing is a single pass
//! with a single barrier however many lights cast. Six passes per light over a
//! shared array image would be serialised by write-after-write, which is exactly
//! what the cascades already pay for four.
//!
//! Nothing here takes a `Device`, for the reason the render graph does not: the
//! allocation and the matrices are the part that can be wrong in a way pixels
//! only hint at, so they are the part CI can assert.
