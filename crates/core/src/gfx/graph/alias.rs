//! Which transients can be handed the same allocation.
//!
//! A transient is undefined at the start of every frame and dead at the end of
//! it, so the only thing that keeps its memory reserved is the span of passes
//! between the first that touches it and the last. Two transients whose spans
//! do not overlap are never wanted at once, and one block of memory can serve
//! both — which is the lifetime information the graph has had since it was a
//! graph and has never spent.
//!
//! # What v1 aliases, and what it deliberately does not
//!
//! **Only images whose allocations are interchangeable**: same descriptor, same
//! usage, same sharing mode. That is a stricter rule than Vulkan's, and it is
//! the strictest thing the compiler can *know* — memory requirements come from
//! a `Device`, and this module has none, so identical create-info is how it
//! establishes identical requirements without asking. It costs the pairs that
//! would fit inside a larger block: the whole half-resolution post chain could
//! live in one full-resolution image's memory, and none of it does.
//!
//! The rule still pays, because a post chain is mostly one shape. At 1080p with
//! every effect on it folds 44 transients into 35 allocations and 318 MB into
//! 241 MB, and the groups are the ones a reader would predict — each
//! full-resolution stage output handed on to a later stage's, so that
//! `subsurface_color`, `oit_color` and `dof_color` are one image and
//! `ssr_color`, `refraction_color` and `motion_blur_color` are another.
//!
//! **Nothing memoryless.** Those ask for `LAZILY_ALLOCATED` memory, which is a
//! different memory type and, on the tiler they exist for, no allocation at all.
//!
//! **No packing at an offset.** Every member of a group sits at offset zero of
//! its own block, so a group is a set of equals rather than a heap with a
//! bump allocator over it. Offsets are what the shape rule above would need to
//! be relaxed, and they are the follow-up if the remaining 241 MB is ever worth
//! attacking.
//!
//! # The dependency it adds
//!
//! Handing B the memory A was using is a write-after-read hazard, and the one
//! the rest of the compiler is built to assume cannot happen (`dependency_edges`
//! orders every reader after every writer *of one resource*, which says nothing
//! about two). `compile` closes it by seeding B's barrier state from A's final
//! one, so B's first access sources A's last — see `State::aliased`. The
//! dependency is therefore derived and emitted exactly like every other one,
//! rather than being a rule the executor has to remember.
