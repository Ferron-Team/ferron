//! Splitting a compiled frame across the device's queues.
//!
//! The graph already knows what depends on what, which is the whole input a
//! queue schedule needs, and #64 item 8 is the observation that nothing was
//! using it. This module is that use: it cuts the pass order into contiguous
//! segments, each submitted to one queue, and names the resources that
//! therefore have to be reachable from both.
//!
//! # Why the cut is where it is
//!
//! A frame is very nearly a chain. Measured on the reference frame with every
//! optical stage on, thirty of its thirty-seven dependency levels hold exactly
//! one pass, so there is almost nothing *inside* one frame for a second queue
//! to run alongside — the whole intra-frame gain available is 7%, and it is all
//! in one place. What a second queue is actually worth is the overlap between
//! frames: this frame's compute tail against the *next* frame's graphics head.
//!
//! That is why every interleaved dispatch stays on the graphics queue. Moving
//! one there and back costs a semaphore each way for a pass the graphics queue
//! would have run anyway. The tail is the only place where what follows on the
//! graphics queue belongs to another frame, so it is the only place where
//! crossing pays — which makes the whole schedule one cut, and the plan
//! something a person can read.
//!
//! # The trailing graphics segment
//!
//! The tonemap is a draw, so it cannot move, and it is last. That is the
//! constraint the whole shape follows from: a queue is consumed in order, so a
//! submission waiting on the compute tail blocks everything behind it on the
//! graphics queue — including the next frame's head, which is the thing the
//! split exists to let run early. The renderer's answer is to hold the trailing
//! segment back and submit it *after* the next frame's head
//! (see `gfx/vulkan/mod.rs`), which is why it is a segment of its own here
//! rather than the end of the first one.
