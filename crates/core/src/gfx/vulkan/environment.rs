//! The environment cubemap and the skybox that draws it.
//!
//! The bake deliberately does not go through the render graph. It runs once at
//! load time, its barrier chain is a straight line, and its output outlives
//! every frame — none of which the graph derives anything useful for. What the
//! frame sees is only the finished cube, which after the bake sits in
//! `ShaderReadOnlyOptimal` and never changes layout again.
//!
//! The skybox is a draw inside the forward render pass rather than a graph node
//! of its own, for the same reason the debug lines are: `msaa_hdr` is declared
//! `store_op: DontCare` and allocated lazily, so on a tile GPU it never reaches
//! DRAM. A separate pass would have to `Store` it and `Load` it back, which
//! trades the whole point of that allocation for a node in the schedule.
