//! Per-pass GPU timing, feeding [`Profiler::push_gpu_span`].
//!
//! One timestamp pair per pass, plus a reserved pair spanning the whole frame so
//! the HUD's single GPU number keeps its meaning. Three properties shape the
//! design:
//!
//! - Timestamps are written during recording but readable only once the GPU has
//!   passed them, so a pass's timing belongs to a frame that closed one or more
//!   frames ago. Every slot therefore carries the profiler frame index it
//!   recorded, and spans are filed retroactively against it.
//! - `reset_query_pool` is illegal inside a render pass, so the whole pool is
//!   reset up front — before any pass has declared itself, which is why the
//!   reset covers `2 * MAX_PASSES` queries rather than the ones actually used.
//! - A pool must not be reset while the GPU may still be reading it, which is
//!   what [`SLOTS`] buys.
//!
//! Both stamps of a pair are `BottomOfPipe`. A timestamp latches once all prior
//! commands have reached the given stage, so a `TopOfPipe` opening stamp can
//! fire while the previous pass is still running: the start reads too early and
//! adjacent passes appear to overlap. Bottom-of-pipe on both means "everything
//! before this has finished" and "this pass has finished", so durations are
//! disjoint and sum to the frame. The cost is that genuinely overlapping work is
//! attributed to whichever pass finishes last — the right trade for a table
//! whose rows are supposed to add up.
