//! Froxel volumetric fog: the air as a grid of cells in front of the camera,
//! each one asked what it scatters and what it blocks.
//!
//! Two dispatches and no full-resolution pass, which is the whole reason the
//! effect fits. `fog_scatter` lights every froxel — a cascade lookup apiece, and
//! the only reason a sunbeam through a window has an edge — and `fog_integrate`
//! marches each column into the running (radiance, transmittance) pair a
//! fragment can apply in one texture fetch. The application itself is a few lines
//! of `shading.glsl` and `skybox.frag`, not a pass: a composite over the frame
//! would move more bytes than the entire simulation above it.
//!
//! The grid is [`FROXEL_SHIFT`]-reduced in screen space and [`FROXEL_SLICES`]
//! deep, so at 1440p it is 160x90x64 — about 920k cells and 7.4 MB a volume.
//! Two volumes and a history is roughly 30 MB of traffic, against the ~60 MB a
//! single full-resolution pass moves. That ratio is the argument for the whole
//! design.
//!
//! The history is **imported**, for the reason the TAA history and the exposure
//! buffer are: a transient is `Undefined` at every frame's start by contract,
//! and a volume that survives a frame boundary is precisely what the depth
//! jitter needs to be averaged by. Two allocations, ping-ponged, so the scatter
//! pass never reads the volume it is writing.
