//! Recording without vulkano's auto-synchronisation, and submitting without its
//! future chain.
//!
//! Everywhere else the engine would record into an `AutoCommandBufferBuilder`,
//! which tracks every resource on the CPU and derives its own barriers — a
//! second synchronisation compiler beside the one in `gfx/graph/`. [`Recorder`]
//! records raw instead, and [`emit_plan`] submits the barriers the graph
//! actually compiled.
//!
//! Four constraints shape what is here, none of them visible from the API:
//!
//! - **Submission must go through `ash`.** A raw `CommandBuffer` cannot
//!   implement `PrimaryCommandBufferAbstract` from outside vulkano — that trait
//!   needs `CommandBufferResourcesUsage`, whose fields are all `pub(crate)` with
//!   no constructor. `GpuFuture::then_execute` and `QueueGuard::submit` both
//!   take it, so neither will accept one.
//! - **Nothing is kept alive.** Every object a recorded command names must
//!   outlive its execution; that is [`KeepAlive`]'s job.
//! - **A raw and an auto command buffer cannot share an image.** Vulkano tracks
//!   per-`Image` whether any command buffer has declared a use of it. The first
//!   auto one assumes `Undefined` and *discards*; later ones assume the image's
//!   fixed layout requirement. A raw buffer declares nothing, so an image it
//!   wrote must reach an auto buffer in the layout that buffer expects — for a
//!   swapchain image, `PresentSrc`.
//! - **Barriers need `synchronization2`.** Without it vulkano narrows
//!   `AccessFlags2` to 32 bits, and every shader-read bit the plan uses sits at
//!   32 or above: they truncate to an empty access mask. `context.rs` requires
//!   the feature for that reason.
