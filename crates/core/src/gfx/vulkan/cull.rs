//! Deciding what each view draws, on the GPU.
//!
//! The CPU sweep in `systems::extract_geometry` answers the same question by
//! testing every renderable against the camera frustum, then against every
//! cascade, then against every shadowing light — a per-entity cost that is
//! invisible at a hundred objects and is most of the frame at ten thousand.
//! Here the tests are one compute dispatch over (instance, view), and what the
//! CPU keeps is only the part that is genuinely per entity: which rows the
//! dispatch is offered, and which batch each belongs to. That walk is still
//! O(entities) — it is a list build and a cached lookup rather than the
//! frustum, cascade and light tests it replaced, and it is what remains to be
//! made incremental.
//!
//! # What a batch is, and why the draw count does not change
//!
//! A batch is one (mesh, material) pair. It is the unit the passes already drew
//! in — `DrawList::runs` collapses an ordered list into exactly these — so the
//! number of draw calls a frame records is the same before and after this
//! module exists. That is deliberate: the recorded draw count was measured flat
//! at 182 for the demo scene whether 126 or 3197 objects were visible, so there
//! was never a draw-call win here to chase. What moves is the *instance count*
//! of each of those draws, from a number the CPU counted to one the GPU wrote.
//!
//! It also decides the shape. One indirect draw per batch keeps each batch's
//! mesh buffers, its pipeline variant and its material index where they are —
//! bound and pushed by the CPU, which is the only reason this does not also
//! require every mesh in one vertex buffer and every material reachable from a
//! shader. A single multi-draw over all batches would need both.
//!
//! # The layout the three buffers agree on
//!
//! Views are numbered: the camera first, then each cascade, then each punctual
//! face. `instance_index` is that numbering major — view `v` owns the block at
//! `v * stride`, and within it batch `b` owns the slice at `instance_base[b]`,
//! wide enough for every live instance of that batch. Nothing is compacted
//! across batches, so a slice is written by one batch's atomics alone and its
//! draw reads `instance_base[b]` as its base whatever the other batches did.
//!
//! `draw_commands` is numbered the same way, `v * batch_count + b`, so the
//! offset a pass hands `draw_indexed_indirect` is arithmetic rather than a
//! lookup.
