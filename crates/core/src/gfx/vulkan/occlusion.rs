//! What the previous frame's depth already covered.
//!
//! The compute cull in [`cull`](super::cull) answers "could this be seen from
//! here" with six planes, which is the question a frustum can answer and the
//! only one it can. Most of what a frustum keeps is behind a wall. This module
//! is the second half of the question: a max-depth pyramid over the depth the
//! frame rasterised, and a test in `cull.comp` that drops a box whose nearest
//! point is behind the farthest surface its screen rect covers.
//!
//! # Why the pyramid is a frame old, and why that is the design and not a
//! shortcut
//!
//! The obvious shape is two-phase: draw what was visible last frame, reduce the
//! depth *that* produced, test everything against it, draw the remainder. It
//! cannot be declared here. The cull writes the commands the prepass draws, the
//! prepass writes the depth, and the pyramid reduces it — so a cull that read a
//! pyramid of this frame's depth would close a ring, and
//! [`compile`](crate::gfx::graph::compile) orders every reader after every
//! writer precisely so that it would report the cycle rather than schedule one
//! of the two orders and leave which one to registration order. Two-phase needs
//! versioned resources, which is a change to the compiler and not to this pass.
//!
//! So the cull tests against the pyramid the *last* frame left, and the two
//! allocations ping-pong the way the TAA history does. What that costs is one
//! frame of latency on a disocclusion: something that comes out from behind a
//! wall is drawn one frame late. What it does not cost is correctness in the
//! other direction, which is the one that matters — see the module's tests and
//! `occluded` in `cull.comp` for the four ways the test refuses to answer.
//!
//! # Why it is not [`SsrPass`](super::ssr::SsrPass)'s pyramid
//!
//! That one reduces with `min`, because a reflection ray needs to know it
//! *cannot* have hit anything yet. A visibility test needs the opposite: the
//! frontmost surface that is farthest away is the one that decides whether a
//! box is hidden everywhere its rect lands. Neither pyramid can stand in for the
//! other, and this one is also half the frame at its base and survives the frame
//! boundary, which a transient by contract does not.
