//! Screen-space reflections: a depth pyramid, one importance-sampled ray per
//! half-resolution pixel, and a composite that swaps the environment's guess for
//! what the ray found.
//!
//! Four dispatches, and each earns its place. The depth pyramid is what makes
//! the march affordable — a ray crossing an empty room steps over it a cell at a
//! time instead of sampling every texel it passes. The colour pyramid is what
//! makes a *rough* reflection affordable: a ray from a wide lobe is a cone, and
//! the level whose texel matches the cone's footprint carries the average of
//! what the cone covers instead of one sample of it. The trace is at half
//! resolution because a stochastic ray is denoised either way, so the resolution
//! it is traced at buys much less than the rays it pays for. The composite is
//! full resolution because it is the pass that touches the frame's colour, and
//! because subtracting the environment term wants this pixel's own material.
//!
//! Where it sits in the frame is not a detail: between the forward pass and the
//! TAA resolve. Before TAA, so the accumulation over the jitter sequence is what
//! denoises the rays; after shading, so what a ray finds is lit.
