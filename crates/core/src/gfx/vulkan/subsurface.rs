//! Subsurface scattering, the screen-space half: two separable blurs over the
//! radiance that left the surface somewhere other than where it arrived, and a
//! composite that adds it back.
//!
//! The analytic half lives in `shading.glsl` and runs in every queue. This is the
//! part that can only run on the opaque one, and the reason is the reason every
//! screen-space effect here has: it reads the geometry prepass, and blended and
//! refractive surfaces are not in it. What those queues get instead is the wrapped
//! diffuse `subsurface_wrap` switches on precisely when this pass is absent — the
//! two model the same transport, so exactly one of them applies at a time.
//!
//! The split that makes any of this correct happens upstream. `forward_sss.frag`
//! writes the diffusible radiance into a second target and leaves every specular
//! lobe in the first, so what is blurred here is only light that physically moved
//! across the surface. Blurring the lit frame instead — the cheap version of this
//! effect, and the one that gives skin a greasy look — would spread the highlights
//! with it.
//!
//! Where it sits in the frame is not a detail: immediately after shading and
//! before the reflections. After shading because there is nothing to diffuse until
//! the surface has been lit; before the reflections because a mirror beside a face
//! should show the face as the frame will show it, and the trace samples whatever
//! colour it is handed.
