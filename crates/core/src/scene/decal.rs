/// A projected decal: a box that stamps maps onto whatever opaque geometry it
/// contains.
///
/// The box is the entity's own transform applied to the unit cube, so a decal is
/// placed, rotated and scaled with the same tools everything else in the scene
/// is, and its extent is its scale in metres. It projects along the entity's
/// **forward**, which is `-Z` — the engine's convention everywhere, and the
/// reason a decal aimed at a wall is authored by pointing at it rather than away
/// from it. The other two axes are the decal's `u` and `v`: `+X` right, `+Y` up.
///
/// Nothing about this is a queue or a pass. A decal is read by the two passes
/// that already rasterise opaque geometry, at the point where they have sampled
/// a surface's maps and before anything is done with them, so what a decal
/// produces *is* the surface as far as the rest of the frame is concerned — it
/// is lit by every light, it is in the reflections, it is under the ambient
/// occlusion. That is what a screen-space stamp composited afterwards cannot be.
///
/// Two consequences worth knowing. It lands on blended and refractive surfaces
/// too, because those shade through the same file. And it lands on *every*
/// surface inside the box, so a decal large enough to swallow a wall's far side
/// stamps that as well — depth is not a test the projection makes, [`angle`] is
/// the tool for it, and a box no deeper than what it should hit is better than
/// either.
