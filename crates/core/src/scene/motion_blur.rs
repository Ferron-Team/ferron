/// open for, and therefore what fraction of that travel lands on the sensor.
///
/// That also makes the effect behave like film rather than like a slider: a
/// scene running at 30 fps blurs twice as far as the same scene at 60 fps for
/// the same angle, which is exactly what a real camera does and what a
