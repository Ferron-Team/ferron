//! The courtyard: the same materials as the rig, arranged as somewhere.
//!
//! Where [`build_default_scene`](super::build_default_scene) separates variables,
//! this composes them, and the two goals genuinely conflict — which is why this
//! is a second scene rather than a restyling of the first. A readout wants a flat
//! floor, an even light and one feature per object; a photograph wants a low sun,
//! an occluder in front of it, and every feature contributing to one image at
//! once. Neither scene can be graded against the other.
//!
//! # What the frame is built around
//!
//! One decision drives the rest: the sun is **low and the camera looks into it**.
//! That is the lighting a volumetric medium is visible in — the Henyey-Greenstein
//! term at `g = 0.75` is about four times its isotropic value at the 26° this
//! camera sits off the sun, and a quarter of it at 90° — and it is the lighting
//! the transmitted subsurface lobe is visible in, because light that crossed a
//! body reaches the eye only when the body is between the eye and the light. So
//! the shafts through the gateway and the glow through the wax are the same
//! choice, not two.
//!
//! Everything else about the layout falls out of one consequence of that choice,
//! and it took a render to take seriously: **in contre-jour the only surface that
//! is both lit and visible is the ground.** A face is visible if it points at the
//! camera and lit if it points at the sun, and here those directions are 150°
//! apart, so the set of normals satisfying both is a thin lune around
//! `forward × sunward` — which, with a camera looking level and a sun 22° up, is
//! very nearly straight up. Hence: a low camera, a floor that fills a third of
//! the frame, and walls kept to four metres so the sun clears them and *lands*
//! on that floor instead of shadowing all sixteen metres of it. The first version
//! of this scene had seven metre walls and a 14° sun, and its courtyard was
//! uniformly sky-lit grey with a blown sky above it.
//!
//! The rest of the frame is what contre-jour is actually good at: silhouettes,
//! rim light, translucency, and the raked relief of the paving.
//!
//! # The second camera
//!
//! What this lighting cannot do is show a wall. `showcase-materials` therefore
//! stands with the sun behind it, looking along the one surface built to be seen
//! that way — the brick pier, whose face points into the sun. That is where the
//! parallax march and the decal sitting in it are legible. It is deliberately not
//! a prettier angle on the same shot.
