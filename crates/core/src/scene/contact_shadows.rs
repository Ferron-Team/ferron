/// hundred-metre range — and the normal-offset bias that keeps that texel from
/// self-shadowing pushes the lookup a texel's width off the surface. Everything
/// closer to the contact than that width is lit whatever the map says, so a
/// chair leg meets the floor in a shadow that starts a hand's breadth away.
/// Marching the depth buffer recovers exactly that band, because it is the one
/// scale at which screen space has more resolution than the map does.
///
/// It shadows the sun and nothing else. The march reads a depth buffer, which
/// only records what the camera can see, so everything about the settings below
/// is about failing quietly where it cannot: the ray is short, it fades with
/// distance, and it fades at the frame's edge.
