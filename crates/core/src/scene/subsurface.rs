/// as the same physics measured at two scales. `Material::subsurface_radius` and
/// `Material::thickness` drive an analytic wrap and a transmittance term in
/// `shading.glsl`, which run in every queue and need no passes at all. On top of
/// that, `enabled` here adds the screen-space diffusion: the forward pass splits
/// the diffusible radiance into a target of its own and two separable blurs spread
/// it across the image before it is added back.
///
/// Turning it off is not turning scattering off — it drops the diffusion and the
/// wrap widens to stand in for it, which is why a scene looks similar either way
/// and different in the detail. What the diffusion buys is the part no per-pixel
/// term can reach: light crossing a silhouette, and a shadow terminator softened
/// by transport rather than by a curve fitted to it.
///
/// Notice what is *not* here: a strength. The forward pass routes this light out of
/// the colour target rather than adding it, so the composite has to add all of it
/// back or the same scene would lose energy by switching a pass on. The dials that
/// belong to the effect are on the material, where they describe a medium.
