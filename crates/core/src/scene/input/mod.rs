//! Input, in three layers.
//!
//! [`state`] holds what the devices are doing: which keys and buttons are down,
//! where the mouse moved, where the sticks are. It is the only layer that knows
//! a backend exists.
//!
//! [`keys`] is the vocabulary — one table naming every source once, so a
//! binding file, the engine's codes and the C# enum cannot drift apart.
//!
//! [`actions`] is what game code sees: named actions and axes, resolved from
//! bindings once a frame. A script names `Jump`, never `Space`, so remapping
//! is a config change rather than an API break.
//!
//! The layers only face one way. Resolution reads device state through public
//! accessors and never the reverse, which is what lets a new backend arrive as
//! an adapter over [`InputState::press`] without anything above it changing.
