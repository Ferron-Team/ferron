//! Named actions and axes, resolved from bindings once per frame.
//!
//! Game code names an action, never a key. The indirection exists so that
//! remapping is a config change rather than an API break, which is only true if
//! nothing above this module ever learns what a binding is.
//!
//! **Resolution runs once per frame**, after the event pump and before scripts
//! tick, and it runs whether or not events arrived and whether or not scripts
//! are ticking. A resolve gated on either leaves the previous frame's state
//! standing, and every edge derived from it fires a frame late or twice.
//!
//! **Edges are the action's own, not any binding's.** An action is held when
//! any of its bindings is, and pressed on the frame its aggregate goes from
//! unheld to held. Aggregating each binding's own edges instead would fire a
//! second press when a second bound key joins one already down.
//!
//! **Ids are interned per name and stable for the process.** They are handed
//! out on first lookup, not by a config, so reloading bindings rewrites what an
//! id points at and never what it is — a script may cache one across a reload,
//! and a name nobody bound still has an id that reads as unpressed. That is
//! what makes reload cheap enough to do on every save.
//!
//! **Axes compose, they do not re-bind.** An axis names two actions, so a key
//! appears in the file exactly once and rebinding `Left` moves `Horizontal`
//! with it. An axis may also read one analog source directly; it may never name
//! another axis, which is what keeps resolution two passes and acyclic.
