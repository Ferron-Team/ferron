//! Device state — what the keyboard, mouse and pads are doing right now —
//! stored as a world resource.
//!
//! The key codes are the engine's own stable numbering, not winit's enum, so
//! scripts can read them through the scripting ABI; [`super::keys`] holds that
//! numbering and the names either side of the boundary spell it with.
//!
//! Events reach this module through [`InputState::press`] and its siblings, and
//! the backends do nothing but decode an event into one of those calls. That is
//! the seam: a new device is a new adapter, and nothing above here — bindings,
//! actions, axes — learns which backend filled the state it reads.
//!
//! `pressed`/`released` are edge-triggered and valid for exactly one frame —
//! [`end_frame`](InputState::end_frame) clears them after scripts have observed
//! them.
