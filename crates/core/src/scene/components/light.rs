/// catches that at compile time. Add variants freely; rename them never.
///
/// Field *names* are the same promise, and adding one to a variant that already
/// ships is the same hazard from the other direction: a scene saved before it
/// existed has no such field, and the derive reports that as a broken entity
/// rather than an old one. `casts_shadows` therefore carries
/// `#[reflect(default = true)]`, which is what lets a point light written by an
/// earlier build load as the shadow caster it would have been.
///
/// # Units
///
/// Every quantity here is photometric, and the field name is the unit — which is
/// also why the old `intensity` is gone rather than reinterpreted. A scene
/// authored against that field fails to load and says which field it is missing;
/// silently reading `intensity = 3` as three lumens would load a scene that is
/// black for a reason nothing reports. Retrofitting this later is what
/// `docs/architecture.md` §3.3 rules out, since it would re-tune every scene
/// anyone had authored.

/// The unit differs per light type because the *fixture* differs, which is the

///
/// - A sun is infinitely far away, so it has no power to speak of and no
///   distance to fall off over. What it has is the illuminance it lays on a
///   surface facing it: **lux**. Full noon sun is about 100 000, an overcast day
///   20 000, a late sunset under 1 000.
/// - A bulb radiates in every direction, and what its box prints is total
///   luminous power: **lumens**. Domestic bulbs are 400–1 600, a shop light
///   3 000–6 000, an architectural flood tens of thousands.
///
/// Both become the candela the shader needs via the conversions below, and both
/// assume **one world unit is one metre** — an inverse-square falloff has to know
/// what the square is of.
