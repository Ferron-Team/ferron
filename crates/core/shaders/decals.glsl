// Projected decals, once. Included by `shading.glsl` — and so by the forward,
// transparency and refraction passes — and by `prepass.frag`, for the reason
// `parallax.glsl` is: a decal changes the albedo, the normal, the `f0` and the
// roughness of the pixel it lands on, and those are exactly the four things the
// prepass exists to report. A prepass that skipped decals would tell
// `ssr_resolve.comp` about the wall as it was before the stamp, and the reflection
// would be subtracted under a weight belonging to a surface nobody can see.
//
// The includer must define, before including this file:
//
//   vec4 decal_sample(uint index, vec2 uv, vec2 dx, vec2 dy)
//
// taking its gradients explicitly, as `parallax_height` does and for the same
// reason: the loop below is per fragment in its trip count, and a derivative
// taken in non-uniform control flow is undefined. The derivatives are computed
// once, up front, where the control flow is still uniform — and they are *exact*
// rather than estimated, because the decal's texture coordinate is an affine
// function of world position, so the world-space derivative pushed through the
// same matrix is the UV-space one.
//
// The texture indices are read out of `decals[i]` at a loop counter bounded by a
// frame-uniform count, so every invocation that reaches a given fetch reaches it
// with the same index. That is what makes plain indexing legal here without
// `nonuniformEXT` — the same argument `sample_tex` makes about
// `push.material_index`, one level further out.
