// The noise filter over the raw occlusion, and — when the term was resolved at
// half the frame's extent — the upsample that puts it back.
//
// Bilateral rather than a plain box, and that is what makes half resolution
// usable: the AO term is low-frequency everywhere except across a depth
// discontinuity, and a box filter there drags the occlusion of a near surface
// out over the far one behind it. At full resolution that is a soft halo one or
// two pixels wide; at half resolution each tap covers four pixels and the same
// halo is wide enough to read as a dark outline around every object.
//
// Weighting each tap by how close its depth is to the centre's costs one extra
// fetch per tap and removes the halo entirely: taps on the far surface simply
// stop contributing to a near pixel's result.
