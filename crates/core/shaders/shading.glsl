// What a surface looks like, once. Included by `forward.frag`, which writes the
// result into the opaque target, and by `oit.frag`, which weights it and
// accumulates it — so a sheet of glass and the wall behind it are lit by the
// same renderer rather than by two that drifted.
//
// Everything below the descriptor declarations is pure: `shade_surface` reads
// the varyings and the bound sets and returns radiance plus opacity. The two
// includers differ only in what they do with that vec4, which is the whole
// point of the split.
//
// Define `ORRIN_TRANSPARENT` before including to shade a blended surface. It
// drops the two screen-space terms — ambient occlusion and the contact-shadow
// march — because both describe whatever the prepass rasterised at this pixel,
// and behind glass that is the wall, not the glass.
//
// Define `ORRIN_REFRACTIVE` instead to shade one the refraction pass draws. It
// drops the same two terms for the same reason, and adds one: the surface reads
// the frame behind it through set 5 and returns it bent, absorbed and weighted
// by what the surface did not reflect. Only that pass may define it — the
// descriptor set does not exist in the other two, and nothing else in the frame
// has a copy of itself to sample.
//
// Define `ORRIN_SUBSURFACE` to say that the frame carries a second colour target
// and runs the screen-space diffusion passes over it. It does two things: the
// diffusible half of the result is kept separate rather than summed, and the
// wrapped diffuse standing in for that diffusion is switched off, because
// applying both would soften the same transport twice. Only the opaque pass may
// define it — the other two queues never reach those passes, so there the wrap is
// the whole of the effect.
//
// The five extra lobes — clear coat, sheen, anisotropy, transmission,
// subsurface — are gated on bits in the material rather than on separate shaders.
// `push.material_index` is dynamically uniform, so each test is a coherent branch
// a draw either takes whole or skips whole; a plain metallic-roughness material
// costs what it did before any of them existed.

// fast alpha changes across the pixel*, which turns the step into a ramp one
// pixel wide and lets the rasteriser quantise it into the four samples the frame
// is already rasterising. That is the whole cost of the feature: one `fwidth`
// and a divide, on the foliage pipeline only.
//
// Called from `main` rather than from inside `shade_surface` for the reason
// `parallax.glsl` takes its gradients before the march: `fwidth` is a
// quad-differencing operation and belongs where the control flow is plainly
// uniform, not somewhere a reader has to prove that it is.
