// The lobe blocks are declared but unread, and both halves of that are
// deliberate. Declared, because std430 derives the array stride from the struct
// and a short mirror would step through the table at the wrong pitch — every
// material past the first would be read out of the middle of its neighbour.
// Unread, because this pass writes the *base* layer's f0 and roughness and
// `ssr_resolve.comp` subtracts exactly that: the clear coat's own reflection
// stays image-based, so nothing here has a second lobe to describe.
//
// Parallax is the one that is read, because it is not a lobe: it changes *where*
// the maps are sampled rather than what is done with them, so this pass and the
// forward pass have to march the same ray to be describing one pixel.
