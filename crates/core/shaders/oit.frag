// Weighted-blended order-independent transparency, accumulation half
// (McGuire & Bavoil 2013).
//
// Nothing here is sorted, and nothing needs to be: the two targets below are
// written with blend equations that are *commutative*, so the same pixel comes
// out whatever order the triangles arrive in. `accum` sums premultiplied
// radiance and coverage under a depth-dependent weight; `reveal` multiplies up
// the transmittance, one minus each surface's alpha. `oit_composite.comp`
// divides the first by its own coverage and mixes by the second.
//
// The price of that is exactness: two surfaces at very different depths are
// resolved by a heuristic weight rather than by their real ordering. What it
// buys is no sort, no popping when two surfaces cross, and one draw per
// (mesh, material) run exactly as the opaque pass gets.

// Blended, so the two screen-space terms in `shading.glsl` do not apply — see
// the comment there.

// The paper's weight function (equation 10): near-opaque and near-camera
// fragments dominate, distant near-transparent ones barely register.
//
// The bounds matter more than the curve. `accum` is a 16-bit float target, so
// the weight has to stay inside a range whose products do not saturate — the
// clamp is what keeps a pile of glass from resolving to Inf and painting the
// pixel white.
