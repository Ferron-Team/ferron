//! The synchronisation tripwire the render graph exists to make possible (#7).
//!
//! A wrong barrier is the worst bug the renderer can have: it produces correct
//! pixels on the machine that wrote it and a race on someone else's scheduler,
//! and it survives review because nobody reads a barrier and sees it is one flag
//! too loose. The graph derives them instead, which means the derivation itself
//! can be pinned — this file renders the reference frame's plan to text and
//! compares it against a checked-in baseline.
//!
//! **What a failure means.** The plan changed. That is legitimate whenever the
//! frame's structure changed on purpose, and a regression whenever it didn't:
//! a barrier that quietly loosens, a transition that disappears, a pass that
//! moves. Read the diff before regenerating — the baseline is the review, so
//! updating it without reading it spends the whole mechanism.
//!
//! Regenerate with `ORRIN_UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 cargo test -p orrin-core --test
//! render_graph`, and put the diff in the commit.
//!
//! It runs on a GPU-less CI runner because compiling a graph takes no `Device`,
//! which is the property that made the derivation worth doing this way.
